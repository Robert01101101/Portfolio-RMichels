Note - doesn't seem to work locally on Windows with XAMPP, or maybe locale is wrong. Seems to work on Hostinger server
gettext also might run into caching issues on shared hosting setups and a lot of people reccommend against using it...





xgettext -n about.php -n src/partials/header.php -n src/partials/footer.php
