    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Clirio Cloud is a collection of tools that have been growing over time. These tools are provided to users of the Clirio Suite on a website developed with Blazor. Clirio builds solutions that help users inspect, document, and collaborate in 3D and XR on geospatial workspaces.</p>

    <p>One of the main goals of Clirio Cloud is to complement the upload and organizational capabilities of the iOS Clirio apps, which serve as the primary capture platform. While a user can easily capture and upload 3D photogrammetry scans with Clirio's iOS apps, they might also want to upload other 3D models, for which Clirio Cloud provides an interface. Other workspace tools are upload and management of custom basemaps, upload of boreholes, guest invitations, point of interest creation, and workspace deletion.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Clirio Cloud provides an analytics dashboard to users, as well as an easy way to access the Clirio knowledge base and training videos. Finally, there also are subscription and account management tools.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>The website was initially set up by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timthibault/" target="_blank">Timothy Thibault</a> using Blazor, to try using a web framework that has C# as its programming language, which would be an advantage considering we also used C# for Unity development. After setting up authentication, subscription management, and workspace listing with metadata, development was mostly handed off to me.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>After adding all of the workspace management features such as 3D model upload and user invitations, I started working on another set of stories revolving around the dashboard. I partnered up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-wischmann-32a4b380/" target="_blank">Jordan Wischmann</a>, who designed mockups, which I then implemented.</p>
